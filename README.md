# DragonflySynthSW

This software implements functionality for the Dragonfly Synthesizer Module.
It is an event-driven architecture. The software interacts with the following peripherals:
 - LEDs (Writes to digital pins)
 - Push buttons (Reads and debounces digital pins)
 - Potentiometers (Reads and interprets ADCs)
 - DAC (Sets output voltage via SPI Communication Protocol)
 - USB (Reads key presses via UART Communication Protocol)

The audio waveform generated by this module is output from the DAC. The
peripherals allow to user to modify settings corresponding to the waveform.
Some features include ADSR envelope control, custom waveform shapes, and
other audio effects. The USB device connected receives key presses to
generate notes from a keyboard emulator.

The input peripherals are read and update waveform settings every 1ms. The
DAC is written to every 25us yielding a 40 kHz sampling rate.
